# scaffolding-redstone-water

This is made with similar working method of Minecraft's scaffolding, redstone and water mechanics.

I looked at the internet for this so much, but didn't know what to search for or found broken links...

So I decided to decompile Minecraft and look at its source code.


And I managed to do it!!! (i guess... IDK its optimized or not, i just made that in few hours...)
